This is even more pronounced in countries where such practices are not endorsed at a governmental level. Recognizing this gap, we decided to create a game that highlights the significance of waste sorting. Our Mobile People team (all teammates are members of [Mobile People community](\nhttps://wearecommunity.io/communities/mobilepeople))\ndecided to create a game that aims to **educate players about how sorting waste not only conserves resources but also facilitates the production of new goods from recycled materials**. By engaging with this interactive experience, we hope to inspire those who have never considered sorting their waste to start doing so, thereby making a small yet meaningful contribution to sustainability. Ultimately, this could lead to a significant impact, demonstrating how individual small actions can collectively make a difference in our world's health and longevity.",
